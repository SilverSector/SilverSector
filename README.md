My Name is Kennith and currently studying Cyber Security. While Cyber Security in itself is a wide variety of different skill sets, I find I enjoy dabbling in a bit of everything. 

I Have an Associates of Information Technology with a concentration in Computer Programming. Before the pandemic hit, I was looking at going towards a Bachelors Degree.

During my free time, I enjoy dabbling in Programming,and learning more about Cyber Security. Projects and progress will be uploaded to GitHub for tracking purposes. Feel free to hit me up if you see something I could be doing better. I am always ready to learn.
